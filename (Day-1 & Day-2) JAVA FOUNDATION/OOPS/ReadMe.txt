Object Oriented Programming : resusability,scalable,write maintainable code,security
Class -- Entity class : POJO - Data(variables)  2) Behaviour(Methods)
      -- Real worls entities : Employee , BankAccount , Student , Teacher , Vehicle
    It has main pillars :
        Class / Object  : from this blueprint which is a class, the actual thing which we create from this blueorint is an object
        Each object has its own data but shares same behaviour

        Encapsulation - Wrapping data+methods together and hiding data using

        Encapsulation - 1) Mainly focus on data  , 2) permission access either to read or write or both 
                        3) validation while setting the data 
                        1) Data security
                        2) Validation Control
                        3) Easy Maintenance

        all attributes of a class are private in nature but indirectly we can 
                        access them so, to achieve  this we create getter and setter methods

                        for eg :  private long password ;  
                        we create a setter method which is write only method to 
                        set the password and we cannot read it as we have not created a getter method for it ( read method) .
        Abstraction : focussing on implementation hiding (achieved by either abstract class or interface)
                      show what to do, and hide how to do

        Inheritance :  when a child class is inheriting the features of base class like a child inherit the properties of father
        Polymorphism :  many forms when one object behaves many forms. 
        There  are two types static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism

        Static Polymorphism : when you have multiple methods with the same name but different
                             signature in same class --overloading
        Dynamic Polymorphism : When you have multiple methods with the same name but different
                             signature in same class --overriding

                          public void salary(String role , int vc)
                      {
                        // manager
                         }   
                }
                Class TeamLead extends Hr{
                     public void salary(String role , int vc)
                {
